# Film Finder

**Film Finder** is a web app that recommends random movies by genre. Users will be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.

Film Finder uses the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API, a movie database website, to request and receive data.

This web app is part of [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)'s Front-End Engineer Career Path.
